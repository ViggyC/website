            Hi, Iâ€™m a 22 yr old professional in the financial services industry.
            I am currently employed at Charles Schwab in the Wealth Asset
            Management Data and Architecture organization, where I do data
            engineering, platform development, software engineering, and DevOps
            using cloud solutions, CI/CD, and best practices for enterprise. I
            graduated summa cum laude from the University of Colorado Boulder
            with a degree in computer science and a minor in business. I am
            starting to deep dive more into machine learning and AI in my free
            time. Besides the nerd stuff I venture into the world of music,
            sports, nature, and mindfulness, and I am contstantly learning.
